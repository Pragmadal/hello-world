# hello-world
I'm learning how to use Github, hello.

I'm new to coding, I just recently figured out how to use methods with Java, but I've been enjoying it; I want to learn more so I can take on bigger challenges.

I love videogames (though I'm not good at FPS's), reading comics, and watching cartoons. From spotted mushrooms with eyes, to sweet rolls. From weird, yellow sponges to laserbeam shooting space monkeys. It's wher I have the most fun, and I'm happy to see all the new stuff that gets made every year.

I'm also a 10ft, purple platapus with a bionic eye.
